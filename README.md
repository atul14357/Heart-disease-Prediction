# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

A Machine Learning project for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical and demographic data. This project leverages multiple classification algorithms to assist in **early detection and prevention of heart disease**.

---

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved results
- Deployment-ready code (Flask/Streamlit integration optional)

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is derived from the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** (Cleveland).  
It includes attributes such as:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Resting ECG results  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- Exercise-induced angina  
- ST depression & slope  
- Number of major vessels  
- Thalassemia  
- **Target**: `1 = presence of heart disease`, `0 = absence`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **IDE/Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  
- **(Optional)**: Flask/Streamlit for deployment
