A **Machine Learning project** to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical and demographic data. The goal is to assist in **early detection and prevention of heart disease**.

---

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training with **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN**
- Performance evaluation using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**
- Deployment-ready pipeline with **Flask/Streamlit** (optional)

---

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset used: **[UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)**  

**Features include:**  
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG results, Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise-induced Angina  
- ST depression & slope, Number of major vessels, Thalassemia  
- **Target**: 1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence
